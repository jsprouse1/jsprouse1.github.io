           <p>I worked for Papa John's Pizza for nearly twenty years.  My final position
           was as a TGM, responsible for the training of all store level management in an 
           9 location region. Having had my fill of food service, I am seeking 
           an education and career in a field much more attuned to my proclivities; software
           development.</p>
